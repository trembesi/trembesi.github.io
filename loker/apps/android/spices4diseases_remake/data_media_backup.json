When fresh and fully mature, it is about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter and dark red, and contains a single seed, like all drupes. Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).</p><p>Black pepper is native to present-day Kerala in South India,[3][4] and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions. Vietnam is the world's largest producer and exporter of pepper, producing 34% of the world's crop, as of 2013.</p><p>Ground dried and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice, and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound piperine, which is a different kind of spicy from the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning, and is often paired with salt and available on dining tables in shakers or mills.</p>",

							"media_konten_body" : "<p>The spice turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties — it’s being studied for its potential to fight cancer, improve liver function, lower cholesterol and stave off Alzheimer’s disease. When you combine it with black pepper, your body absorbs a thousand times more curcumin (turmeric’s active ingredient).<p>And it doesn’t take much. If people are given a bunch of turmeric, within an hour there’s a little bump in the level in their blood stream. We don’t see a large increase because our liver is actively trying to get rid of it. But what if the process is suppressed by taking just a quarter teaspoon’s worth of black pepper? Then you see curcumin levels skyrocket. The same amount of curcumin consumed, but the bioavailability shoots up 2000%. Even just a little pinch of pepper—1/20th of a teaspoon—can significantly boost levels. And guess what a common ingredient in curry powder is besides turmeric? Black pepper.<p>Another way to boost the absorption of curcumin is to consume it in the whole food, turmeric root (fresh or dried as a powder) because natural oils found in turmeric root and turmeric powder can enhance the bioavailability of curcumin seven to eight fold. When eaten with fat, curcumin can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream through the lymphatic system thereby in part bypassing the liver.<h4>Turmeric Rice Recipe</h4><h4>Ingredients</h4><ul><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li><li>1 small onion, chopped (use more if you wish)</li><li>1/2 bell pepper, chopped (use more if you wish)</li><li>1/4 cup sun dried tomatoes, chopped (optional)</li><li>1 cup uncooked rice, preferably brown</li><li>1 teaspoon salt</li><li>Pinch of Black Pepper (I forgot this in the video)</li><li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li><li>2 cups broth or water</li></ul><h4> Directions</h4><ul><li>Heat olive oil in a skillet or saucepan with a lid. Add onion, pepper and tomato, if using. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. </li><li>Add rice and stir to mix well; cook for another minute or two. Add liquid, salt and turmeric. Cover, adjust heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender (about 40 minutes for brown, 20 minutes for white). If the rice isn't tender when the liquid has been absorbed, add a little more liquid and continue simmering for a few minutes. </li></ul>",

							"media_konten_body" : "<p>Candlenut (also known by Aleurites Moluccanus) is actually a flowering tree in the genus Aleurites belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. The genus contains two species: A. moluccanus (L.) Willd and Aleurites rockinghamensis (Baill.) P.I.Forst. The plant is native to Indo-Malaysia region.  They are grown largely in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Queensland as well as some parts of Australia. It is also commonly known as Indian walnut, Candleberry, Candlenut, Candlenut-tree, Kukui, Lumbangtree, Varnishtree, Bankul nut tree, Indonesian walnut, Kukui nut, Moluccan oil tree, Tallow tree, Buah Keras, Tung-nut, Otaheite walnut, Balucanat and Belgaum walnut. Genus name comes from the Greek word aleuron meaning floury in reference to the white flour-like dusting present on juvenile leaves. Specific epithet means from the Moluccas (aka Spice Islands) located in eastern Indonesia which is part of the native habitat for this tree.</p><h4>Plant Description</h4><p>Candlenut is a medium sized, perennial, evergreen, upper-canopy tree that grows about 10–47 m tall. The plant thrives best in a warm, humid tropical environment. It is common in wet secondary forest at the margins or along stream and along the seashore. It will also thrive in a semi dry to wet subtropical forest climate and in areas. Candlenut trees grow on a wide variety of soils which includes acidic soils, sandy soils, red loamy soils, limestone and stony clay soils. They are not fond of alkaline soils. However, they can tolerate soils which are neutral to slightly alkaline. The soil should be moist and well drained. These trees also have a good tolerance for infertile soils. The plant has straight and cylindrical bole and can be up to 70 – 150 cm in diameter. Bark is grey-brown to blackish colored.</p><h4>Leaves</h4><p>The leaves are very distinctively shaped but also quite variable in gross morphology. Young leaves and leaves on lower branches are often three-lobed or five-lobed, while older leaves and those on higher branches tend to be a simpler triangular or oval shape. They are typically 10–20cm long with wavy margins, and are arranged alternately. Where the leaf stalk joins the blade of the leaf, there are a pair of glands that produce a sweet secretion. The petioles are almost 30 centimeters in length. The leaves have a pale green coloration.</p><h4>Flowers</h4><p>The inflorescence is around 10 to 20 centimeters in length. They have an upper axillary or terminal and thyrsoid arrangement. The unisexual flowers are white in color. The female flowers are found on the ultimate branchlets of cymes. The smaller male flowers are arranged all around the female flowers in groups. The sepal is comprised of 2 or 3 lobes at the anthesis. The male flowers are comprised of 5 lance-shaped petals around 6 to 7 mm in length and almost 10 to 20 stamens. The petals are larger in the female flowers, around 9 or 10 mm.</p><h4>Nuts</h4><p>Fruit is a round nut that is 4 to 6 centimeters in diameter. They have a hard shell covering which is green or brown in color. Inside the hard shell there is the whitish flesh or pulp. Single nuts grow on stout stalks. The nuts contain one or two seeds.</p><h4>Seeds</h4><p>The soft, elliptical, cream-colored seeds are found inside the nut. The seed coats covering the seeds are very hard. The length of each seeds is around 2.5 centimeters. The seeds are filled with rich contents of inflammable oil that enables the seeds to burn as candles. The seed shells are white in color which turns black as they mature.<h4><h4>History</h4><p>The tree is probably native to a vast region from India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia to northern Australia. The exact origin of this tree is unknown because of its early spread by humans. The plant is often cultivated throughout tropical Asia and Oceania as an ornamental plant.</p>",

							"media_konten_body" : "<p>Cardamom comes from the seeds of several different plants that belong to the same family as ginger. It has a distinctive flavor that complements both sweet and savory dishes. People may use cardamom seeds and pods in curries, desserts, and meat dishes, as well as in beverages, such as coffee and chai tea.</p><p>People may also take cardamom as a supplement for its health benefits. Cardamom contains phytochemicals that have anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.</p><p>Researchers have conducted several small studies on cardamom, the findings of which suggest that it has some health benefits. Although these studies are promising, large and controlled human studies are necessary before healthcare professionals can recommend cardamom to treat medical problems.</p><ol><li><strong>Antimicrobial ability</strong><p>One study found that cardamom essential oil was effective in killing several different types of bacteria and fungi. The researchers suggested that the oil's antibacterial activity may be due to its ability to damage the cell membrane of certain bacteria.</p><p>Cardamom essential oil showed 'antimicrobial activity against almost all test microorganisms' in other research, while another study concluded that this oil could be a component in new antimicrobial drugs.</p><p>People should not ingest cardamom essential oil, however, and they should always speak to a doctor before using any new herbal remedy. Some products can interact with existing medication or cause side effects.</p></li><li><strong>Metabolic syndrome and diabetes</strong><p>Some studies suggest that cardamom could help with some aspects of metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Metabolic syndrome is a group of health conditions that can lead to heart disease and type 2 diabetes. It includes:</p><ul><li>obesity</li><li>high blood sugar</li><li>hypertension</li><li>high triglycerides</li><li>high cholesterol</li><li>low levels of 'good' cholesterol</li></ul><p>In one animal study, in which the researchers fed rats a diet high in carbohydrate and fat, the rodents that also consumed cardamom powder had a lower weight and better cholesterol than those that did not receive this supplement.</p><p>A double-blind trial found that cardamom could help improve certain biomarkers that can cause inflammation and disease.</p><p>The researchers recruited women who were overweight or had obesity and also had prediabetes and high cholesterol. Their findings showed that the women who took cardamom for 8 weeks had lower levels of C-reactive protein, inflammatory proteins, and other markers that can contribute to health problems.</p><p>In another study, researchers gave 83 people with type 2 diabetes either green cardamom or a placebo. Those who took cardamom saw health benefits, including improved hemoglobin A1c and insulin levels, after 10 weeks.</p></li><li><strong>Heart health</strong><p>Some animal research has linked cardamom with boosting heart health, though many more studies are necessary before researchers know how the spice affects human heart health.</p><p>The findings of a study in rats suggest that cardamom could help protect against heart attacks. The authors suggest that its antioxidant activities could help improve heart function, but they note the need for studies in humans to confirm these findings.</p><p>Another study in rats found that cardamom oil could help improve cholesterol levels in rats. The researchers fed rats a high cholesterol diet for 8 weeks. The rats that received cardamom had significantly lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels at the end of the study.</p></li><li><strong>Oral health</strong><p>While many people may think of mint and cinnamon as breath fresheners, people have used cardamom for this purpose for centuries.</p><p>They have done so not just because of its flavor. Cardamom may help fight bacteria in the mouth, a common cause of bad breath, cavities, and gum disease.</p><p>A recent study found that cardamom seeds and fruit could help improve oral health due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The findings showed that the cardamom extract was effective in disrupting bacteria that can lead to gum disease or infections.</p><p>In a randomized trial, researchers asked the participants to chew either fennel or cardamom seeds for 5 minutes. The researchers found that chewing either type of seed was effective in balancing the pH in the mouth, which may help prevent the development of cavities.</p></li><li><strong>Liver health</strong><p>In Ayurvedic medicine, people use cardamom for its detoxifying properties. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence to confirm this benefit, cardamom does appear to have some helpful effects on the liver, which plays a crucial role in removing toxins from the body.</p><p>One study involved people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease who were overweight or had obesity. The participants who took green cardamom supplements had improvements in markers of liver health compared with those who took a placebo.</p><p>In another animal study, scientists fed rats a high fat, high carbohydrate diet and measured certain liver health markers. After 8 weeks, the rats that received cardamom had lower levels of liver stress than the rats that ate an unsupplemented diet. This finding suggests that cardamom could help protect the liver from certain types of damage.</p></li><li><strong>Anticancer properties</strong><p>Cardamom contains natural phytochemicals that may be able to fight diseases such as cancer. It cannot take the place of cancer treatment, but some studies suggest that the spice could have cancer-fighting properties.</p><p>For example, one study found that giving mice cardamom supplements for 15 days resulted in a reduction in the size and weight of their skin tumors.</p></li><li><strong>Ulcer prevention</strong><p>Like ginger, its cousin, cardamom could help with digestive ailments. Some people use the spice to make a stomach-soothing tea. It may also be useful in protecting the stomach from ulcers.</p><p>In a recent study, researchers induced stomach ulcers in rats by giving them high doses of aspirin. They then gave some of the rats cardamom extract to see how it affected their ulcers. The rats that ate cardamom extract had smaller and fewer ulcers than the rats that did not receive it.</p><p>Another study produced similar findings. The researchers discovered that cardamom extract, in combination with turmeric and sembung leaf, helped protect against stomach ulcers in rats. Some of the rats received aspirin alone, while others received the herbal extract and then aspirin. The rats that received the extract had fewer and smaller ulcers than the rats that did not receive the herbs.</p></li></ol>",

							"media_konten_body" : "<ol><li><strong>May Cause Liver Damage</strong><p>Cassia (or regular) cinnamon is a rich source of coumarin.</p><p>The coumarin content of ground Cassia cinnamon may range from 7 to 18 milligrams per teaspoon (2.6 grams), while Ceylon cinnamon only contains trace amounts of coumarin.</p><p>The tolerable daily intake of coumarin is approximately 0.05 mg/pound (0.1 mg/kg) of body weight, or 5 mg per day for a 130-pound (59-kg) person. This means that just 1 teaspoon of Cassia cinnamon could put you over the daily limit (3Trusted Source).</p><p>Unfortunately, several studies have found that eating too much coumarin may cause liver toxicity and damage (4, 5Trusted Source).</p><p>For example, a 73-year-old woman developed a sudden liver infection causing liver damage after taking cinnamon supplements for only 1 week (7Trusted Source). However, this case involved supplements that provided a higher dose than you would get from diet alone.</p><strong>Summary: </strong><ul><li>Regular cinnamon contains high amounts of coumarin. Studies have shown that eating too much coumarin may increase the risk of liver toxicity and damage.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>May Increase the Risk of Cancer</strong><p>Animal studies have shown that eating too much coumarin, which is abundant in Cassia cinnamon, may increase the risk of certain cancers (3Trusted Source).</p><p>For example, studies in rodents have found that eating too much coumarin can cause cancerous tumors to develop in the lungs, liver, and kidneys (8, 9, 10Trusted Source).</p><p>The way in which coumarin may cause tumors is unclear.</p><p>However, some scientists believe that coumarin causes DNA damage over time, increasing the risk of cancer (11).</p> <p>Most research on the cancerous effects of coumarin has been performed on animals. More human-based research is needed to see if the same link between cancer and coumarin applies to humans.</p><strong>Summary: </strong><ul><li>Animal studies have found that coumarin may increase the risk of certain cancers. However, more research is needed to determine whether this also applies to humans.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>May Cause Mouth Sores</strong><p>Some people have experienced mouth sores from eating products that contain cinnamon flavoring agents (12, 13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).</p><p>Cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, a compound that may trigger an allergic reaction when consumed in large amounts. Small amounts of the spice don’t seem to cause this reaction, as saliva prevents chemicals from staying in contact with the mouth for too long.</p><p>In addition to mouth sores, other symptoms of a cinnamaldehyde allergy include:</p><ul><li>tongue or gum swelling </li><li>a burning or itching sensation </li><li>white patches in the mouth </li></ul><p>While these symptoms aren’t necessarily serious, they can cause discomfort (14Trusted Source).</p><p>However, it’s important to note that cinnamaldehyde will only cause mouth sores if you’re allergic to it. You can get tested for this type of allergy with a skin patch test (15Trusted Source).</p><p>Also, mouth sores seem to mostly affect those who use too much cinnamon oil and cinnamon-flavored chewing gums, as these products can contain more cinnamaldehyde. </p><strong>Summary: </strong><ul><li>Some people are allergic to a compound in cinnamon called cinnamaldehyde, which can cause mouth sores. However, this seems to mostly affect people who use too much cinnamon oil or chewing gum, as these products contain more cinnamaldehyde.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>May Cause Low Blood Sugar</strong><p>Having chronic high blood sugar is a health problem. If left untreated, it may lead to diabetes, heart disease, and many other health problems (16).</p><p>Cinnamon is well-known for its ability to lower blood sugar. Studies have found that the spice can mimic the effects of insulin, a hormone that helps remove sugar from the blood (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).</p><p>While eating a bit of cinnamon may help lower your blood sugar, eating too much may cause it to fall too low. This is called hypoglycemia. It can lead to tiredness, dizziness, and possibly fainting (20Trusted Source).</p><p>People who are most at risk of experiencing low blood sugar are those taking medications for diabetes. This is because cinnamon may enhance the effects of these medications and cause your blood sugar to fall too low.</p><strong>Summary: </strong><ul><li>While eating cinnamon may help lower your blood sugar, eating too much may cause it to fall too low, especially if you’re on medication for diabetes.

Further research is needed to determine how lower amounts may affect humans.</p><p>Test-tube studies show that the compounds in cloves may reduce cancer cell growth and promote cancer cell death. More research is needed to confirm these effects in humans.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>Can Kill Off Bacteria</strong><p>Cloves have been shown to have antimicrobial properties, meaning they can help stop the growth of microorganisms like bacteria.</p><p>One test-tube study showed that clove essential oil was effective at killing off three common types of bacteria, including E. coli, a strain of bacteria that can cause cramps, diarrhea, fatigue and even death.</p><p>What’s more, the antibacterial properties of cloves could even help promote oral health.</p><p>In one test-tube study, the compounds extracted from cloves were found to stop the growth of two types of bacteria that contribute to gum disease.</p><p>Another study in 40 people tested the effects of an herbal mouthwash consisting of tea tree oil, cloves and basil.</p><p>After using the herbal mouthwash for 21 days, they showed improvements in gum health, as well as the amount of plaque and bacteria in the mouth.</p><p>In combination with regular brushing and proper oral hygiene, the antibacterial effects of cloves may benefit your oral health.</p><p>Studies show that cloves may promote oral health, thanks to their antimicrobial properties, which may help kill harmful bacteria.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Improve Liver Health</strong><p>Studies show that the beneficial compounds in cloves could help promote liver health.</p><p>The compound eugenol may be especially beneficial for the liver.</p><p>One animal study fed rats with fatty liver disease mixtures containing either clove oil or eugenol.</p><p>Both mixtures improved liver function, reduced inflammation and decreased oxidative stress.</p><p>Another animal study showed that the eugenol found in cloves helped reverse signs of liver cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver.</p><p>Unfortunately, research on the liver-protecting effects of cloves and eugenol in humans is limited.</p><p>However, one small study found that taking eugenol supplements for one week decreased levels of GST, an enzyme involved in detoxification that’s often a marker of liver disease.</p><p>Cloves are also high in antioxidants, which may help prevent liver disease due to their ability to help decrease oxidative stress .</p><p>Nevertheless, keep in mind that eugenol is toxic in high amounts. One case study in a 2-year-old boy showed that 5 to 10 ml of clove oil caused serious liver damage.</p><p>Some studies show that cloves and the compounds they contain may help reduce oxidative stress and protect the liver.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Help Regulate Blood Sugar</strong><p>Research shows that the compounds found in cloves may help keep blood sugar under control.</p><p>An animal study found that clove extract helped moderate blood sugar increases in diabetic mice.</p><p>Another test-tube and animal study looked at the effects of clove extract and nigericin, a compound found in cloves, both on human muscle cells and in diabetic mice.</p><p>Cloves and nigericin were found to increase the uptake of sugar from the blood into cells, increase the secretion of insulin and improve the function of cells that produce insulin.</p><p>Insulin is a hormone responsible for transporting sugar from your blood into your cells. The proper functioning of insulin is essential for maintaining steady blood sugar levels.</p><p>In combination with a balanced diet, cloves could help keep your blood sugar levels in check.</p><p>Test-tube and animal studies have shown that the compounds in cloves may help promote insulin production and lower blood sugar.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Promote Bone Health</strong><p>Low bone mass is a condition that affects an estimated 43 million older adults in the US alone.</p><p>It can lead to the development of osteoporosis, which may increase the risk of breaks and fractures.</p><p>Some of the compounds in cloves have been shown to help preserve bone mass in animal studies.</p><p>For example, an animal study found that clove extract high in eugenol improved several markers of osteoporosis and increased bone density and strength.</p><p>Cloves are also rich in manganese, providing an impressive 30% of the daily recommended amount in just 1 teaspoon (2 grams) of ground cloves.</p><p>Manganese is a mineral that’s involved in the formation of bone and incredibly important to bone health.</p><p>An animal study found that taking manganese supplements for 12 weeks increased bone mineral density and bone growth.</p><p>However, current research on the effects of cloves on bone mass is mostly limited to animal and test-tube studies. More research is needed to determine how it may affect bone formation in humans.</p><p>Animal studies show that clove extract and manganese may help increase bone mineral density. More research is needed to confirm these effects.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Reduce Stomach Ulcers</strong><p>Some research indicates that the compounds found in cloves could help treat stomach ulcers.</p><p>Also known as peptic ulcers, stomach ulcers are painful sores that form in the lining of the stomach, duodenum or esophagus.</p><p>They are most commonly caused by reductions in the protective lining of the stomach that are due to factors like stress, infection and genetics.</p><p>In one animal study, the essential oil from cloves was shown to increase the production of gastric mucus.</p><p>Gastric mucus functions as a barrier and helps prevent erosion of the stomach lining from digestive acids.</p><p>Another animal study found that clove extract helped treat stomach ulcers and had effects similar to several anti-ulcer medications .</p><p>Though the anti-ulcer effects of cloves and their compounds may be promising, further studies are needed on their effects in humans.</p><p>Some animal studies show that clove extract and clove oil may increase the production of gastric mucus and help protect against stomach ulcers.

Garlic has been used safely in research for up to 7 years. When taken by mouth, garlic can cause bad breath, a burning sensation in the mouth or stomach, heartburn, gas, nausea, vomiting, body odor, and diarrhea. These side effects are often worse with raw garlic. Garlic may also increase the risk of bleeding. There have been reports of bleeding after surgery in people who have taken garlic. Asthma has been reported in people working with garlic, and other allergic reactions are possible.<p></li><li><strong>When applied to the skin:</strong><p>Garlic products are <strong>POSSIBLY SAFE</strong> when applied to the skin. Gels, pastes, and mouthwashes containing garlic have been used for up to 3 months. However, when applied to the skin, garlic might cause skin damage that is similar to a burn.</p><p>RAW garlic is <strong>POSSIBLY UNSAFE</strong> when applied to the skin. Raw garlic might cause severe skin irritation when it is applied to the skin.</p></li></ol><br><h4><font color='blue'>Special Precautions & Warnings:</font></h4><ol><li><strong>Pregnancy and breast-feeding:</strong><p>Garlic is <strong>LIKELY SAFE</strong> to use during pregnancy when taken in the amounts normally found in food. Garlic is <strong>POSSIBLY UNSAFE</strong> when used in medicinal amounts during pregnancy and when breast-feeding.

Stay on the safe side and avoid use.</p></li><li><strong>Children: </strong><p>Garlic is <strong>POSSIBLY SAFE</strong> when taken by children as a medicine short-term. However, garlic is <strong>POSSIBLY UNSAFE</strong> when taken by mouth in large doses. Some sources suggest that high doses of garlic could be dangerous or even fatal to children. The reason for this warning is not known. There are no case reports available of significant adverse events or mortality in children associated with taking garlic by mouth. When applied to the skin, garlic might cause damage to the skin that is similar to a burn.</p></li><li><strong>Bleeding disorder: </strong><p>Garlic, especially fresh garlic, might increase the risk of bleeding.</p></li><li><strong>Diabetes: </strong><p>Garlic can lower blood sugar.

							"media_konten_body" : "<p>Ginger contains chemicals that may reduce nausea and inflammation. Researchers believe the chemicals work primarily in the stomach and intestines, but they may also work in the brain and nervous system to control nausea.</p><ol><li><strong>Nausea and vomiting caused by drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS (antiretroviral-induced nausea and vomiting). </strong><p>Research suggests that taking ginger daily, 30 minutes before each dose of antiretroviral treatment for 14 days, reduces the risk of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving HIV treatment.</p></li><li><strong>Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). </strong><p>Research shows that taking ginger powder 500-2000 mg during the first 3-4 days of a menstrual cycle modestly decreases pain in women and teens with painful menstrual periods. Ginger was given for approximately 3 days starting at the beginning of the menstrual period or at the beginning of pain. Some research shows that taking ginger seems to work about as well as some pain medications, like ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, or Novafen.</p></li><li><strong>Osteoarthritis. </strong><p>Most research shows that taking ginger by mouth can slightly reduce pain in some people with osteoarthritis. There is some evidence that taking ginger by mouth works as well as certain drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac for pain in hip and knee osteoarthritis. But conflicting results exist. Some early research also shows that ginger gel applied to the knee or ginger oil massaged into the knee can also relieve osteoarthritis pain.</p></li><li><strong>Morning sickness. </strong><p>Taking ginger by mouth seems to reduce nausea and vomiting in some pregnant women. But it might work slower or not as well as some drugs used for nausea. Also, taking any herb or medication during pregnancy is a big decision. Before taking ginger, be sure to discuss the possible risks with your healthcare provider.</p></li><li><strong>Dizziness (vertigo). </strong><p>Taking ginger seems to reduce the symptoms of dizziness, including nausea.</p></li><li><strong>Muscle soreness caused by exercise. </strong><p>Research shows that taking ginger does not reduce muscle pain during exercise. Also, taking ginger doesn't seem to help treat or prevent muscle pain after exercise.</p></li><li><strong>Motion sickness. </strong><p>Most research suggests that taking ginger up to 4 hours before travel does not prevent motion sickness. Some people report feeling better, but actual measurements taken during studies suggest otherwise. But in one study, ginger appears to be more effective than the drug dimenhydrinate at reducing stomach upset associated with motion sickness.</p></li><li><strong>A sudden and serious lung condition (acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS). </strong><p>Research suggests that administering 120 mg of ginger extract daily for up to 21 days increases the number of days without ventilator support, the amount of nutrients consumed, and reduces the time spent in intensive care units in people with sudden respiratory system a failure. However, ginger extract does not seem to affect death rates in people with this condition.</p></li><li><strong>Nausea and vomiting caused by cancer drug treatment.</strong><p>Taking ginger along with anti-nausea medicine does not seem to prevent delayed nausea and vomiting in people treated with cancer drugs. This type of nausea and vomiting occurs a day or more after cancer therapy. The effect of ginger on sudden nausea and vomiting due to cancer drugs is conflicting. Some research shows it helps when used with anti-nausea medicine. Other research shows it doesn't. It's possible that ginger helps reduce nausea caused by only some cancer drugs. It's also possible that ginger helps reduce nausea caused by cancer drugs only when used with anti-nausea medicines that don't work very well on their own.</p></li><li><strong>A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD).</strong><p>Research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (AKL1, AKL International Ltd) containing ginger twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve respiratory symptoms in people with COPD.</p></li><li><strong>Diabetes.</strong><p>Taking ginger seems to lower blood sugar in some people with diabetes. Doses of at least 3 grams of ginger per day seem to be needed. Lower doses might not help. And ginger might need to be taken for at least 3 months before benefits are seen.</p></li><li><strong>Indigestion (dyspepsia). </strong><p>Research suggests that taking a single dose of 1.2 grams of ginger root powder one hour before eating speeds up how quickly food empties out of the some in people with dyspepsia.</p></li><li><strong>Hangover. </strong><p>Early research suggests that taking a combination of ginger, pith of Citrus tangerine, and brown sugar before drinking decreases symptoms of alcohol hangovers, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p></li><li><strong>High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia).</strong><p>Research suggests that taking 1 gram of ginger three times daily for 45 days lowers triglyceride and cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol.</p></li><li><strong>High blood pressure. </strong><p>Drinking black tea with ginger might lower blood pressure by a small amount in people with diabetes and high blood pressure.</p></li><li><strong>Insect bite. </strong><p>Early research shows that applying Trikatu to the skin, which contains ginger, long pepper, and black pepper extracts, does not reduce mosquito bite size.</p></li><li><strong>A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS).</strong><p>Taking ginger alone doesn't seem to improve IBS symptoms. But taking ginger along with other herbal ingredients might help. Whether the benefit of these combination agents is due to ginger or the other ingredients is unclear.</p></li><li><strong>Joint pain.</strong><p>Research shows that taking capsules of a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital, Charlotte, NC) containing ginger for 8 weeks reduces joint pain by 37%. But this product does not seem to reduce joint stiffness or improve joint function.</p></li><li><strong>Abnormally heavy bleeding during menstrual periods (menorrhagia).</strong><p>Taking ginger might reduce menstrual bleeding in some young women with heavy menstrual bleeding.</p></li><li><strong>Migraine.</strong><p>Some reports suggest that taking a combination of ginger and feverfew might reduce the length and intensity of migraine pain. However, it is not clear if the effects are from ginger, feverfew or the combination.</p></li><li><strong>Obesity.</strong><p>Taking ginger alone doesn't seem to help obese people lose significant amounts of weight. Taking a ginger with other herbs does not result in consistent improvements in weight loss.</p></li><li><strong>Childbirth.</strong><p>Early evidence suggests that bathing in water containing ginger oil does not shorten the length of labor.</p></li><li><strong>Recovery after surgery.</strong><p>Inhaling and applying lavender and ginger oils to the skin before surgery does not seem to reduce distress in children after surgery. Taking ginger by mouth might help reduce pain and improve wound healing in children who've had their tonsils removed.</p></li><li><strong>Nausea and vomiting after surgery. </strong><p>The research for using ginger to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery is unclear. Some clinical research shows that taking ginger by mouth one hour before surgery reduces nausea and vomiting during the first 24 hours after surgery. But not all research agrees. Taking ginger by mouth doesn't seem to have added benefit when used with prescription medications for nausea and vomiting. Keep in mind that most patients are not supposed to eat or drink anything before surgery, so talk to your doctor first if you are interested in taking ginger before surgery. Ginger aromatherapy has also been studied. Placing ginger oil on patients' wrists or on a gauze pad before surgery seems to prevent nausea in some patients.</p></li><li><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</strong><p>There is some early evidence that ginger might be helpful for decreasing joint pain in people with RA.</p></li><li><strong>Trouble swallowing.</strong><p>Evidence suggests that spraying a product containing ginger and clematix root in the mouth improves severe problems swallowing in stroke victims. However, it is not beneficial in people with less severe problems swallowing. Also, taking a single ginger tablet doesn't help people with trouble swallowing due to aging.</p></li><li><strong>Liver damage caused by chemicals.</strong><p>Some drugs used to treat tuberculosis can cause liver damage. Taking ginger along with these drugs might help prevent liver damage in some people.</p></li><li><strong>Anorexia.</strong></li><br><li><strong>An infection of the intestines that causes diarrhea (cholera).</strong></li><br><li><strong>Baldness.</strong></li><br><li><strong>Bleeding.</strong></li><br><li><strong>Colds.</strong></li><br><li><strong>Flu.</strong></li><br><li><strong>Loss of appetite.</strong></li><br><li><strong>Toothaches.</strong></li><br><li><strong>Other conditions.</strong></li></ol>",

There is also a report of miscarriage during week 12 of pregnancy in a woman who used ginger for morning sickness. However, most studies in pregnant women suggest that ginger can be used safely for morning sickness without harm to the baby. The risk for major malformations in infants of women taking ginger does not appear to be higher than the usual rate of 1% to 3%. Also there doesn't appear to be an increased risk of early labor or low birth weight. There is some concern that ginger might increase the risk of bleeding, so some experts advise against using it close to your delivery date. As with any medication given during pregnancy, it's important to weigh the benefit against the risk. Before using ginger during pregnancy, talk it over with your healthcare provider.</p></li><li><strong>Children:</strong><p>Ginger is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for up to 4 days by teenage girls around the start of their period.</p></li><li><strong>Breast-feeding:</strong><p>There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking ginger if you are breast feeding.

							"media_konten_header" : "Benefits of Nutmeg",
							"media_konten_body" : "<ol><li><strong>It Promotes Digestion</strong><p>Nutmeg is a powerhouse of the properties that can treat indigestion effectively. In yesteryears, it was specifically added to the cuisines to promote digestion and combat factors like nausea. Moreover, nutritionists suggest that the dietary fiber found in the spice functions to regulate irregular bowel movements. Consuming nutmeg regularly cannot only stimulate digestion but can treat intestinal problems as well.</p></li><li><strong>For Oral Health</strong><p>Oral diseases are silent yet daunting. In most cases, oral problems go unnoticed because they aren’t painful and constant ignorance often results in oral cancer. Nutmeg can contribute to treating various oral problems such as cavities, bleeding gums, toothache, etc. Moreover, bacteria inside your tooth cause a toothache, and if not treated on time, it can result in tooth decay. That is where nutmeg comes into the picture as it is a powerhouse of antibacterial properties. Incorporating nutmeg into food is said to be effective for your oral health and can help relieve a toothache.</p></li><li><strong>Works as a Detoxifier</strong><p>Factors like chemical, excess salts, toxins, etc. can damage liver cells adversely. With damaged cells, your liver will be more likely to fall prey to chronic liver diseases. This is why you need to detoxify your liver and nutritionists recommend opting for a natural product in this regard. Incorporating spices like nutmeg can prevent your liver from the adverse effects of environmental pollution, stress, unbalanced diet and medication.</p></li><li><strong>For Kidney Health</strong><p>Like other organs, maintaining kidney health is essential too. Nutmeg is said to be a diuretic in nature and promote proper urination that results in healthy kidneys. Moreover, many studies have proved that adding nutmeg to your food or consuming a pinch of it can help dissolve kidney stones effectively. However, it is advised to consult with your primary care physician in case of severe kidney condition and to avoid self-medication.</p></li><li><strong>It Treats Insomnia</strong><p>Insomnia is one of the most irritating health problems that encourage you to opt for medication in this regard. Medication has a potential to worsen the case as they are addictive and cannot provide a solution in the long run. And you can become an insomniac again once you stop the medicines. Nutritionists revealed that nutmeg could do the job for you. It works as menthol that relaxes the stressed mind and relieves mental pressure that will allow you to sleep. You can add a pinch of nutmeg powder into a glass of warm milk to treat chronic insomnia.</p></li><li><strong>It Relieves Pain</strong><p>Many studies have been carried out to identify if this miraculous spice can relieve headaches or other body pains or not. Nutmeg is packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties that not only relieve headaches but help ease pain associated with injuries and wounds. Moreover, it is potent enough to combat factors that contribute to chronic inflammation like the condition of arthritis.</p></li><li><strong>For Cancer</strong><p>Antioxidants are known to ward off free radicals that promote cancerous cells in your body. Scientists have found that being enriched with antioxidants, nutmeg can help alleviate risks that contribute to the development of cancerous cells. However, the studies are at initial levels, and more evidence is required to determine the positive effects of nutmeg regarding cancer treatment.</p></li><li><strong>A Powerful Antioxidant</strong><p>Your body needs plenty of antioxidants not only to treat cancerous cells or free radicals but to prevent chronic inflammation and oxidative damage. Nutritionists encouraged to incorporating spices like nutmeg – in any form, to your daily life. Antioxidants, when combined with other nutrients like copper, potassium, iron, etc., can effectively combat factors that contribute to chronic diseases like asthma, Alzheimer, and even depression.</p></li><li><strong>Proper Blood Circulation</strong><p>Proper blood circulation can facilitate blood circulation in your body. When blood circulates through your heart and brain, both vital organs perform their function effectively. Moreover, nutmeg is widely used in herbal medicine to regulate high blood pressure levels. Nutritionists suggest that potassium found in the spice can relax your blood vessels and allow proper blood circulation.</p></li><li><strong>For Psychological Diseases</strong><p>Psychological diseases like dementia and Alzheimer often occur in old age where you frequently forget things and found it difficult to recall. Aging also affects your concentration and cognitive function. You can take precautions in young age to avoid age-related problems like these by incorporating nutmeg into your daily routine. The components like macelignan found in the spice are said to sharpen your brain improving your memory. Nutmeg has potential to alleviate risks associated with Alzheimer’s diseases and can prevent its occurrence in old age.</p></li><li><strong>For Immune System</strong><p>Your immune system performs many functions that include destroying infectious bacteria, free radicals, and cancerous cells. To do the job, your immune system needs nutrients like manganese, iron, potassium, and various vitamins that can be found in wondrous nutmeg.</p></li><li><strong>Acne Treatment</strong><p>Acne occurrence can put you under severe stress that causes more acne If after laborious efforts, your acne vanishes, it leaves a scar. That is where nutmeg comes into the picture. Being an antibacterial, it can ward off acne-causing bacteria effectively. You apply a paste of powdered nutmeg on the acne scar, and it will begin fading within weeks. The spice can work fine for acne if you add it to your food regularly.</p></li><li><strong>It Delays Aging</strong><p>Fine lines, wrinkles, sagged skin, etc. are primary indicators of aging that is nothing less than a nightmare. Nutrients suggest incorporating some amount of nutmeg into your diet and let the properties found in it do the job for you.</p></li></ol>",

							"media_konten_body" : "<p>Turmeric may be the most effective nutritional supplement in existence.</p><p>Many high-quality studies show that it has major benefits for your body and brain.</p><p>Here are the top 10 evidence-based health benefits of turmeric.</p><ol><li><strong>Turmeric Contains Bioactive Compounds With Powerful Medicinal Properties</strong><p>Turmeric is the spice that gives curry its yellow color.</p><p>It has been used in India for thousands of years as a spice and medicinal herb.</p><p>Recently, science has started to back up what Indians have known for a long time — it really does contain compounds with medicinal properties .</p><p>These compounds are called curcuminoids, the most important of which is curcumin.</p><p>Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric. It has powerful anti-inflammatory effects and is a very strong antioxidant.</p><p>However, the curcumin content of turmeric is not that high. It’s around 3%, by weight.</p><p>Most of the studies on this herb are using turmeric extracts that contain mostly curcumin itself, with dosages usually exceeding 1 gram per day.</p><p>It would be very difficult to reach these levels just using the turmeric spice in your foods.</p><p>Therefore, if you want to experience the full effects, you need to take a supplement that contains significant amounts of curcumin.</p><p>Unfortunately, curcumin is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream. It helps to consume black pepper with it, which contains piperine, a natural substance that enhances the absorption of curcumin by 2,000%.</p><p>The best curcumin supplements contain piperine, substantially increasing their effectiveness.</p><p>Curcumin is also fat soluble, so it may be a good idea to take it with a fatty meal.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Turmeric contains curcumin, a substance with powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Most studies used turmeric extracts that are standardized to include large amounts of curcumin.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Curcumin Is a Natural Anti-Inflammatory Compound</strong><p>Inflammation is incredibly important.</p><p>It helps your body fight foreign invaders and also has a role in repairing damage.</p><p>Without inflammation, pathogens like bacteria could easily take over your body and kill you.</p><p>Although acute, short-term inflammation is beneficial, it can become a major problem when it becomes chronic and inappropriately attacks your body's own tissues.</p><p>Scientists now believe that chronic, low-level inflammation plays a major role in almost every chronic, Western disease. This includes heart disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, Alzheimer's and various degenerative conditions.</p><p>Therefore, anything that can help fight chronic inflammation is of potential importance in preventing and even treating these diseases.</p><p>Curcumin is strongly anti-inflammatory. In fact, it’s so powerful that it matches the effectiveness of some anti-inflammatory drugs, without the side effects.</p><p>It blocks NF-kB, a molecule that travels into the nuclei of your cells and turns on genes related to inflammation. NF-kB is believed to play a major role in many chronic diseases.</p><p>Without getting into the details (inflammation is extremely complicated), the key takeaway is that curcumin is a bioactive substance that fights inflammation at the molecular level.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Chronic inflammation contributes to many common Western diseases. Curcumin can suppress many molecules known to play major roles in inflammation.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Turmeric Dramatically Increases the Antioxidant Capacity of the Body</strong><p>Oxidative damage is believed to be one of the mechanisms behind aging and many diseases.</p><p>It involves free radicals, highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons.</p><p>Free radicals tend to react with important organic substances, such as fatty acids, proteins or DNA.</p><p>The main reason antioxidants are so beneficial is that they protect your body from free radicals.</p><p>Curcumin is a potent antioxidant that can neutralize free radicals due to its chemical structure.</p><p>In addition, curcumin boosts the activity of your body's own antioxidant enzymes.</p><p>In that way, curcumin delivers a one-two punch against free radicals. It blocks them directly, then stimulates your body's own antioxidant defenses.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Curcumin has powerful antioxidant effects. It neutralizes free radicals on its own but also stimulates your body's own antioxidant enzymes.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Curcumin Boosts Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Linked to Improved Brain Function and a Lower Risk of Brain Diseases</strong><p>Back in the day, it was believed that neurons weren't able to divide and multiply after early childhood.</p><p>However, it’s now known that this does happen.</p><p>Neurons are capable of forming new connections, but in certain areas of the brain they can also multiply and increase in number.</p><p>One of the main drivers of this process is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a type of growth hormone that functions in your brain.</p><p>Many common brain disorders have been linked to decreased levels of this hormone, including depression and Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Interestingly, curcumin can increase brain levels of BDNF.</p><p>By doing this, it may be effective in delaying or even reversing many brain diseases and age-related decreases in brain function.</p><p>It may also improve memory and make you smarter, which seems logical given its effects on BDNF levels. However, controlled studies in people are needed to confirm this.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Curcumin boosts levels of the brain hormone BDNF, which increases the growth of new neurons and fights various degenerative processes in your brain.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Curcumin Should Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease</strong><p>Heart disease is the number 1 cause of death in the world.</p><p>Researchers have studied it for many decades and learned a lot about why it happens.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, heart disease is incredibly complicated and various things contribute to it.</p><p>Curcumin may help reverse many steps in the heart disease process.</p><p>Perhaps the main benefit of curcumin when it comes to heart disease is improving the function of the endothelium, which is the lining of your blood vessels.</p><p>It’s well known that endothelial dysfunction is a major driver of heart disease and involves an inability of your endothelium to regulate blood pressure, blood clotting and various other factors.</p><p>Several studies suggest that curcumin leads to improvements in endothelial function. One study found that it’s as effective as exercise while another shows that it works as well as the drug Atorvastatin.</p><p>In addition, curcumin reduces inflammation and oxidation (as discussed above), which play a role in heart disease as well.</p><p>One study randomly assigned 121 people, who were undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, either a placebo or 4 grams of curcumin per day, a few days before and after the surgery.</p><p>The curcumin group had a 65% decreased risk of experiencing a heart attack in the hospital (32Trusted Source).</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Curcumin has beneficial effects on several factors known to play a role in heart disease. It improves the function of the endothelium and is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and antioxidant.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Turmeric Can Help Prevent (And Perhaps Even Treat) Cancer</strong><p>Cancer is a terrible disease, characterized by uncontrolled cell growth.</p><p>There are many different forms of cancer, which still have several things in common. Some of them appear to be affected by curcumin supplements.</p><p>Curcumin has been studied as a beneficial herb in cancer treatment and been found to affect cancer growth, development and spread at the molecular level.</p><p>Studies have shown that it can contribute to the death of cancerous cells and reduce angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels in tumors) and metastasis (spread of cancer).</p><p>Multiple studies indicate that curcumin can reduce the growth of cancerous cells in the laboratory and inhibit the growth of tumors in test animals.</p><p>Whether high-dose curcumin (preferably with an absorption enhancer like piperine) can help treat cancer in humans has yet to be studied properly.</p><p>However, there is evidence that it may prevent cancer from occurring in the first place, especially cancers of the digestive system like colorectal cancer.</p><p>In a 30-day study in 44 men with lesions in the colon that sometimes turn cancerous, 4 grams of curcumin per day reduced the number of lesions by 40%.</p><p>Maybe curcumin will be used along with conventional cancer treatment one day. It's too early to say for sure, but it looks promising and is being intensively studied.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Curcumin leads to several changes on the molecular level that may help prevent and perhaps even treat cancer.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Curcumin May Be Useful in Preventing and Treating Alzheimer's Disease</strong><p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and a leading cause of dementia.</p><p>Unfortunately, no good treatment is available for Alzheimer's yet.</p><p>Therefore, preventing it from occurring in the first place is of utmost importance.</p><p>There may be good news on the horizon because curcumin has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier (39Trusted Source).</p><p>It’s known that inflammation and oxidative damage play a role in Alzheimer's disease, and curcumin has beneficial effects on both.</p><p>In addition, a key feature of Alzheimer's disease is a buildup of protein tangles called amyloid plaques. Studies show that curcumin can help clear these plaques.</p><p>Whether curcumin can really slow down or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease in people is currently unknown and needs to be studied properly.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Curcumin can cross the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to lead to various improvements in the pathological process of Alzheimer’s disease.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Arthritis Patients Respond Very Well to Curcumin Supplements</strong><p>Arthritis is a common problem in Western countries.</p><p>There are several different types, most of which involve inflammation in the joints.</p><p>Given that curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory compound, it makes sense that it may help with arthritis.</p><p>Several studies show this to be true.</p><p>In a study in people with rheumatoid arthritis, curcumin was even more effective than an anti-inflammatory drug.</p><p>Many other studies have looked at the effects of curcumin on arthritis and noted improvements in various symptoms.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Arthritis is a common disorder characterized by joint inflammation. Many studies show that curcumin can help treat symptoms of arthritis and is in some cases more effective than anti-inflammatory drugs.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Studies Show That Curcumin Has Incredible Benefits Against Depression</strong><p>Curcumin has shown some promise in treating depression.</p><p>In a controlled trial, 60 people with depression were randomized into three groups.</p><p>One group took Prozac, another group one gram of curcumin and the third group both Prozac and curcumin.</p><p>After 6 weeks, curcumin had led to improvements that were similar to Prozac. The group that took both Prozac and curcumin fared best.</p><p>According to this small study, curcumin is as effective as an antidepressant.</p><p>Depression is also linked to reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and a shrinking hippocampus, a brain area with a role in learning and memory.</p><p>Curcumin boosts BDNF levels, potentially reversing some of these changes.</p><p>There is also some evidence that curcumin can boost the brain neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>A study in 60 people with depression showed that curcumin was as effective as Prozac in alleviating symptoms of the condition.</li></ul></li><br><br><li><strong>Curcumin May Help Delay Aging and Fight Age-Related Chronic Diseases</strong><p>If curcumin can really help prevent heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's, it would have obvious benefits for longevity.</p><p>For this reason, curcumin has become very popular as an anti-aging supplement.</p><p>But given that oxidation and inflammation are believed to play a role in aging, curcumin may have effects that go way beyond just preventing disease.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ul><li>Due to its many positive health effects, such as the potential to prevent heart disease, Alzheimer’s and cancer, curcumin may aid longevity.</li></ul></li></ol>",
