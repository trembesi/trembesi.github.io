<ol><li><strong>High in Antioxidants</strong><p>As well as containing several important vitamins and minerals, cloves are rich in antioxidants</p><p>Antioxidants are compounds that reduce oxidative stress, which can contribute to the development of chronic disease.</p><p>Cloves also contain a compound called eugenol, which has been shown to act as a natural antioxidant.</p><p>In fact, a test-tube study found that eugenol stopped oxidative damage caused by free radicals five times more effectively than vitamin E, another potent antioxidant.</p><p>In addition to eugenol, ground cloves contain vitamin C.</p><p>Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant in your body and helps neutralize free radicals, which are compounds that can build up and cause harmful oxidative stress.</p><p>Including cloves in your diet along with other antioxidant-rich foods can help improve your overall health.</p><p>Cloves are high in antioxidants, including eugenol and vitamin C, both of which can help reduce oxidative stress.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Protect Against Cancer</strong><p>Some research shows that the compounds found in cloves can help protect against cancer.</p><p>One test-tube study found that clove extract helped stop the growth of tumors and promoted cell death in cancer cells.</p><p>Another test-tube study had similar results, showing that concentrated amounts of clove oil caused cell death in 80% of esophageal cancer cells.</p><p>The eugenol found in cloves has also been shown to have anti-cancer properties.</p><p>A test-tube study found that eugenol effectively promoted cell death in cervical cancer cells.</p><p>However, keep in mind that these test-tube studies used very concentrated amounts of clove extract, clove oil and eugenol.</p><p>Eugenol is toxic in high amounts and overdosing on clove oil may cause liver damage, especially in children. Further research is needed to determine how lower amounts may affect humans.</p><p>Test-tube studies show that the compounds in cloves may reduce cancer cell growth and promote cancer cell death. More research is needed to confirm these effects in humans.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>Can Kill Off Bacteria</strong><p>Cloves have been shown to have antimicrobial properties, meaning they can help stop the growth of microorganisms like bacteria.</p><p>One test-tube study showed that clove essential oil was effective at killing off three common types of bacteria, including E. coli, a strain of bacteria that can cause cramps, diarrhea, fatigue and even death.</p><p>What’s more, the antibacterial properties of cloves could even help promote oral health.</p><p>In one test-tube study, the compounds extracted from cloves were found to stop the growth of two types of bacteria that contribute to gum disease.</p><p>Another study in 40 people tested the effects of an herbal mouthwash consisting of tea tree oil, cloves and basil.</p><p>After using the herbal mouthwash for 21 days, they showed improvements in gum health, as well as the amount of plaque and bacteria in the mouth.</p><p>In combination with regular brushing and proper oral hygiene, the antibacterial effects of cloves may benefit your oral health.</p><p>Studies show that cloves may promote oral health, thanks to their antimicrobial properties, which may help kill harmful bacteria.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Improve Liver Health</strong><p>Studies show that the beneficial compounds in cloves could help promote liver health.</p><p>The compound eugenol may be especially beneficial for the liver.</p><p>One animal study fed rats with fatty liver disease mixtures containing either clove oil or eugenol.</p><p>Both mixtures improved liver function, reduced inflammation and decreased oxidative stress.</p><p>Another animal study showed that the eugenol found in cloves helped reverse signs of liver cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver.</p><p>Unfortunately, research on the liver-protecting effects of cloves and eugenol in humans is limited.</p><p>However, one small study found that taking eugenol supplements for one week decreased levels of GST, an enzyme involved in detoxification that’s often a marker of liver disease.</p><p>Cloves are also high in antioxidants, which may help prevent liver disease due to their ability to help decrease oxidative stress .</p><p>Nevertheless, keep in mind that eugenol is toxic in high amounts. One case study in a 2-year-old boy showed that 5 to 10 ml of clove oil caused serious liver damage.</p><p>Some studies show that cloves and the compounds they contain may help reduce oxidative stress and protect the liver.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Help Regulate Blood Sugar</strong><p>Research shows that the compounds found in cloves may help keep blood sugar under control.</p><p>An animal study found that clove extract helped moderate blood sugar increases in diabetic mice.</p><p>Another test-tube and animal study looked at the effects of clove extract and nigericin, a compound found in cloves, both on human muscle cells and in diabetic mice.</p><p>Cloves and nigericin were found to increase the uptake of sugar from the blood into cells, increase the secretion of insulin and improve the function of cells that produce insulin.</p><p>Insulin is a hormone responsible for transporting sugar from your blood into your cells. The proper functioning of insulin is essential for maintaining steady blood sugar levels.</p><p>In combination with a balanced diet, cloves could help keep your blood sugar levels in check.</p><p>Test-tube and animal studies have shown that the compounds in cloves may help promote insulin production and lower blood sugar.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Promote Bone Health</strong><p>Low bone mass is a condition that affects an estimated 43 million older adults in the US alone.</p><p>It can lead to the development of osteoporosis, which may increase the risk of breaks and fractures.</p><p>Some of the compounds in cloves have been shown to help preserve bone mass in animal studies.</p><p>For example, an animal study found that clove extract high in eugenol improved several markers of osteoporosis and increased bone density and strength.</p><p>Cloves are also rich in manganese, providing an impressive 30% of the daily recommended amount in just 1 teaspoon (2 grams) of ground cloves.</p><p>Manganese is a mineral that’s involved in the formation of bone and incredibly important to bone health.</p><p>An animal study found that taking manganese supplements for 12 weeks increased bone mineral density and bone growth.</p><p>However, current research on the effects of cloves on bone mass is mostly limited to animal and test-tube studies. More research is needed to determine how it may affect bone formation in humans.</p><p>Animal studies show that clove extract and manganese may help increase bone mineral density. More research is needed to confirm these effects.</p></li><br><br><li><strong>May Reduce Stomach Ulcers</strong><p>Some research indicates that the compounds found in cloves could help treat stomach ulcers.</p><p>Also known as peptic ulcers, stomach ulcers are painful sores that form in the lining of the stomach, duodenum or esophagus.</p><p>They are most commonly caused by reductions in the protective lining of the stomach that are due to factors like stress, infection and genetics.</p><p>In one animal study, the essential oil from cloves was shown to increase the production of gastric mucus.</p><p>Gastric mucus functions as a barrier and helps prevent erosion of the stomach lining from digestive acids.</p><p>Another animal study found that clove extract helped treat stomach ulcers and had effects similar to several anti-ulcer medications .</p><p>Though the anti-ulcer effects of cloves and their compounds may be promising, further studies are needed on their effects in humans.</p><p>Some animal studies show that clove extract and clove oil may increase the production of gastric mucus and help protect against stomach ulcers. More research in humans is needed.</p></li></ol>
