Side Effects


<p>While turmeric does provide potential health benefits, it creates some risks that are worth considering before consuming large amounts.</p><ol><li><strong>Upsetting the stomach</strong><p>The same agents in turmeric that support digestive health can irritate when taken in large amounts. Some participants in studies looking at the use of turmeric for cancer treatment had to drop out because their digestion was so negatively affected.</p><p>urmeric stimulates the stomach to produce more gastric acid. While this helps some people's digestion, it can negatively affect others.</p></li><li><strong>Blood-thinning properties</strong><p>The purifying properties of turmeric may also lead to easier bleeding more easily. The reason for this is unclear. Other suggested benefits, such as lowered cholesterol and lowered blood pressure, might have something to do with the way turmeric functions in your blood.</p><p>People who take blood-thinning drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin), should avoid consuming large doses of turmeric.</p></li><li><strong>Stimulating contractions</strong><p>You may have heard that eating foods seasoned with curry can stimulate labor. Although there exists little clinical data to back up this claim, studies suggest turmeric can ease symptoms of PMS.</p><p>Pregnant women should avoid taking turmeric supplements because of its blood-thinning effects. Adding small amounts of turmeric to food as a spice should not cause health problems.</p></li><ol>
