10 Evidence-Based Health Benefits of Cinnamon
   
<p>Cinnamon is a highly delicious spice.</p>
<p>It has been prized for its medicinal properties for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Modern science has now confirmed what people have known for ages.</p>
<p>Here are 10 health benefits of cinnamon that are supported by scientific research.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon Is High in a Substance With Powerful Medicinal Properties</font></strong>
<p>Cinnamon is a spice that is made from the inner bark of trees scientifically known as Cinnamomum.</p>
<p>It has been used as an ingredient throughout history, dating back as far as Ancient Egypt. It used to be rare and valuable and was regarded as a gift fit for kings.</p>
<p>These days, cinnamon is cheap, available in every supermarket and found as an ingredient in various foods and recipes.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ceylon cinnamon:</strong> Also known as 'true' cinnamon.</li>
<li><strong>Cassia cinnamon:</strong> The more common variety today and what people generally refer to as 'cinnamon.'</li>
</ul>
<p>Cinnamon is made by cutting the stems of cinnamon trees. The inner bark is then extracted and the woody parts removed.</p>
<p>When it dries, it forms strips that curl into rolls, called cinnamon sticks. These sticks can be ground to form cinnamon powder.</p>
<p>The distinct smell and flavor of cinnamon are due to the oily part, which is very high in the compound cinnamaldehyde (2Trusted Source).</p>
<p>Scientists believe that this compound is responsible for most of cinnamon's powerful effects on health and metabolism.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cinnamon is a popular spice. It’s high in cinnamaldehyde, which is thought to be responsible for most of cinnamon’s health benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon Is Loaded With Antioxidants</font></strong>
<p>Antioxidants protect your body from oxidative damage caused by free radicals.</p>
<p>Cinnamon is loaded with powerful antioxidants, such as polyphenols (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).</p>
<p>In a study that compared the antioxidant activity of 26 spices, cinnamon wound up as the clear winner, even outranking "superfoods" like garlic and oregano (6Trusted Source).</p>
<p>In fact, it is so powerful that cinnamon can be used as a natural food preservative (7Trusted Source).</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Cinnamon contains large amounts of highly potent polyphenol antioxidants.</li></ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon Has Anti-Inflammatory Properties</font></strong>
<p>Inflammation is incredibly important.</p>
<p>It helps your body fight infections and repair tissue damage.</p>
<p>However, inflammation can become a problem when it’s chronic and directed against your body's own tissues.</p>
<p>Cinnamon may be useful in this regard. Studies show that this spice and its antioxidants have potent anti-inflammatory properties (8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>The antioxidants in cinnamon have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help lower your risk of disease.</li></ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon May Cut the Risk of Heart Disease</font></strong>
<p>Cinnamon has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, the world's most common cause of premature death.</p>
<p>In people with type 2 diabetes, 1 gram or about half a teaspoon of cinnamon per day has been shown to have beneficial effects on blood markers.</p>
<p>It reduces levels of total cholesterol, “bad” LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, while “good” HDL cholesterol remains stable (10Trusted Source).</p>
<p>More recently, a big review study concluded that a cinnamon dose of just 120 mg per day can have these effects. In this study, cinnamon also increased “good” HDL cholesterol levels (11Trusted Source).</p>
<p>In animal studies, cinnamon has been shown to reduce blood pressure (3Trusted Source).</p>
<p>When combined, all these factors may drastically cut your risk of heart disease.</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Cinnamon may improve some key risk factors for heart disease, including cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure.</li></ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon Can Improve Sensitivity to the Hormone Insulin</font></strong>
<p>Insulin is one of the key hormones that regulate metabolism and energy use.</p>
<p>It’s also essential for transporting blood sugar from your bloodstream to your cells.</p>
<p>The problem is that many people are resistant to the effects of insulin.</p>
<p>This is known as insulin resistance, a hallmark of serious conditions like metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The good news is that cinnamon can dramatically reduce insulin resistance, helping this important hormone do its job (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).</p>
<p>By increasing insulin sensitivity, cinnamon can lower blood sugar levels, as discussed in the next chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Cinnamon has been shown to significantly increase sensitivity to the hormone insulin.</li></ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon Lowers Blood Sugar Levels and Has a Powerful Anti-Diabetic Effect</font></strong>
<p>Cinnamon is well known for its blood-sugar-lowering properties.</p>
<p>Apart from the beneficial effects on insulin resistance, cinnamon can lower blood sugar by several other mechanisms.</p>
<p>First, cinnamon has been shown to decrease the amount of glucose that enters your bloodstream after a meal.</p>
<p>It does this by interfering with numerous digestive enzymes, which slows the breakdown of carbohydrates in your digestive tract (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).</p>
<p>Second, a compound in cinnamon can act on cells by mimicking insulin (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).</p>
<p>This greatly improves glucose uptake by your cells, though it acts much slower than insulin itself.</p>
<p>Numerous human studies have confirmed the anti-diabetic effects of cinnamon, showing that it can lower fasting blood sugar levels by 10–29% (18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).</p>
<p>The effective dose is typically 1–6 grams or around 0.5–2 teaspoons of cinnamon per day.</p>

<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Cinnamon has been shown to reduce fasting blood sugar levels, having a potent anti-diabetic effect at 1–6 grams or 0.5–2 teaspoons per day.</li></ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon May Have Beneficial Effects on Neurodegenerative Diseases</font></strong>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of the structure or function of brain cells.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are two of the most common types.</p>
<p>Two compounds found in cinnamon appear to inhibit the buildup of a protein called tau in the brain, which is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).</p>
<p>In a study in mice with Parkinson's disease, cinnamon helped protect neurons, normalized neurotransmitter levels and improved motor function (24Trusted Source).</p>
<p>These effects need to be studied further in humans.</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Cinnamon has been shown to lead to various improvements for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in animal studies. However, human research is lacking.</li></ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon May Protect Against Cancer</font></strong>
<p>Cancer is a serious disease, characterized by uncontrolled cell growth.</p>
<p>Cinnamon has been widely studied for its potential use in cancer prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>Overall, the evidence is limited to test-tube and animal studies, which suggest that cinnamon extracts may protect against cancer (25Trusted Source, 26Tr</p>
<p>It acts by reducing the growth of cancer cells and the formation of blood vessels in tumors and appears to be toxic to cancer cells, causing cell death.</p>
<p>A study in mice with colon cancer revealed that cinnamon is a potent activator of detoxifying enzymes in the colon, protecting against further cancer growth (30Trusted Source).</p>
<p>These findings were supported by test-tube experiments, which showed that cinnamon activates protective antioxidant responses in human colon cells (31Trusted Source).</p>
<p>Whether cinnamon has any effect in living, breathing humans needs to be confirmed in controlled studies.</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Animal and test-tube studies indicate that cinnamon may have protective effects against cancer.</li></ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon Helps Fight Bacterial and Fungal Infections</font></strong>
<p>Cinnamaldehyde, one of the main active components of cinnamon, may help fight various kinds of infection.</p>
<p>Cinnamon oil has been shown to effectively treat respiratory tract infections caused by fungi.</p>
<p>It can also inhibit the growth of certain bacteria, including Listeria and Salmonella (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).</p>
<p>However, the evidence is limited and so far cinnamon has not been shown to reduce infections elsewhere in the body.</p>
<p>The antimicrobial effects of cinnamon may also help prevent tooth decay and reduce bad breath (34Trusted Source, 35).</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Cinnamaldehyde has antifungal and antibacterial properties, which may reduce infections and help fight tooth decay and bad breath.</li></ul>
</li>
<br><br>
<li>
<strong><font color="blue">Cinnamon May Help Fight the HIV Virus</font></strong>
<p>HIV is a virus that slowly breaks down your immune system, which can eventually lead to AIDS, if untreated.</p>
<p>Cinnamon extracted from Cassia varieties is thought to help fight against HIV-1, the most common strain of the HIV virus in humans (36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source).</p>
<p>A laboratory study looking at HIV-infected cells found that cinnamon was the most effective treatment of all 69 medicinal plants studied (38Trusted Source).</p>
<p>Human trials are needed to confirm these effects.</p>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<ul><li>Test-tube studies have shown that cinnamon can help fight HIV-1, the main type of HIV virus in humans.</li></ul>
